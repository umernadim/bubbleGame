# 🫧 Bubble Game – JavaScript Practice Project

A fun and simple **bubble-clicking game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project was created purely as a **logic-building and DOM manipulation exercise** for frontend development practice.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

* A random number (0–9) is shown as the **target**.
* Click on matching bubbles as fast as you can before the **60-second timer** runs out.
* Each correct click gives you **+10 points** and resets the bubble grid with a new target.
* At the end of the timer, your **final score** is displayed with a **"Play Again"** button.
